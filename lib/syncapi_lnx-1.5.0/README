 Installation instructions for 
 the OMNIKEY API for synchronous cards (SYNC-API)
   
 Version 1.5.0

***************************************************************

------------------------------
 What it is
------------------------------

You need this API in order to have access to synchronous cards.
This version currently supports 2-Wire-, 3-Wire- and I2C-Bus-Cards.

------------------------------
 What you need
------------------------------

[1] PCSCLite Version >= 1.2.9-beta7 available at 
    http://www.linuxnet.com/ 
      and/or 
    http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pcsclite/

[2] PCSC driver for CardMan devices that supports this API.
    It is recommended that you download the latest version from
    http://www.omnikey.com
    
------------------------------
 SYNC-API Installation
------------------------------

After you have downloaded the tarball extract it in any directory.
 
  # tar -xzvf syncapi_lnx-1.5.0.tar.gz

change to the created directory and ensure to run the installation
script as user root.
  
  # ./install

This script checks if PCSCLite is installed and
it copies all necessary files under the tree
/usr/local

If you use the package config tool the
installation script additionally copies 
the pkg-info-file to /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.

If you like to install the files in another directory,
for example to /home/mysyncapi, you can achieve
this simply by typing the following.

  # ./install -prefix /home/mysyncapi
  
------------------------------
! Note                       !
------------------------------

1. Ensure that PCSC-Lite is configured with the options
   --enable-libusb and --enable-extendedapdu.
   Moreover it is also necessary to install libusb
   AND its corresponding development sources package that
   is e.g. for DEBIAN libusb-dev or for MANDRIVA libusb-devel
